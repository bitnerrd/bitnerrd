## Hi, This Side Irfan! 👋
## Backend Engineer 
Well, let's get the boring part out of the way. I'm a Software Engineer, a problem-solver, and a bit of a tea snob. 😏☕ If you see me without tea, keep your distance. On a serious note, though, I have a passion for creating efficient and scalable backend that can handle anything you throw at them (or almost anything, no throwing coffee, please).
