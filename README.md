### About Me 📝
Well, let's get the boring part out of the way. I'm a backend developer, a problem-solver, and a bit of a tea snob. 😏☕ If you see me without tea, keep your distance. On a serious note, though, I have a passion for creating efficient and scalable backends that can handle anything you throw at them (or almost anything, no throwing coffee, please).

### Tech Stack 🛠
- **Languages:** Javascript, TypeScript, CSS3 _(Yes, I know CSS. Don't be too shocked.)_
- **Backend Bliss:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Sequelize
- **Databases I've Dated:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **DevOps & Cloud:** Azure, AWS _(because why settle for just one cloud?)_
- **Best Practices:** REST APIs, OOP _(Because, let's face it, who wants bad practices?)_
- **Frontend Flirtations:** Bootstrap _(I know, I'm a backend guy, but sometimes you've gotta know what the frontend folks are up to.)_
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub _(Because CTRL+Z doesn't always cut it.)_

### Let's Connect 🌐
Because what's a tech profile without some shameless self-promotion? Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irrfanabid/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/binryNerd) or shoot me an email at `irfanabid.913@gmail.com`.

Oh, and if you ever want to bribe me, I take my Kashmiri tea. 😉
